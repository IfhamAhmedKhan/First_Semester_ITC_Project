<h4 style="font-size:25px">Cyberpunk 2077:</h4>
<p style="color:yellow">Platform:Pc RPG, Xbox one and PS4/PS5</p>
<h2 style="color:black">About:</h2>
<pre style="font-family:Lucida Fax;color:yellow">cyberpunk 2077 is played in a first-person perspective as V, a mercenary whose voice, face, hairstyles, body type and modifications, 
background, and clothing are customisable. Stat categories—Body, Intelligence, Reflexes, Technical, and Cool—are influenced by the character classes 
that players assume, which are NetRunner (hacking), Techie (machinery), and Solo (combat). V must consult a "ripperdoc" to upgrade and purchase 
cyberware implants; black markets offer military-grade abilities. The rarity of any given equipment is shown by a coloured tier system. V can take 
cover, aim, run, jump, double jump, and slide. Melee strikes can be dealt with close-combat weapons. There are three types of ranged weapons, 
all of which can be customised and modified—Power (standard), Tech (which penetrate walls and enemies), and Smart (with homing bullets). Ranged 
weapons are equipped to ricochet bullets in a target's direction and slow them down in bullet time. 
Four types of damage can be inflicted and resisted—Physical, Thermal, EMP, and Chemical. Weapon use increases 
accuracy and reloading speed, which are manifested in character animations. Gunsmiths repair and upgrade weapons. The game can be completed 
without killing anyone, with non-lethal options for weapons and cyberware.

The open world metropolis Night City, California, consists of six regions—the corporate City Center, immigrant-inhabited Watson, luxurious Westbrook, 
suburban Heywood, gang-infested Pacifica, and industrial Santo Domingo. Its surrounding area, the Badlands, can also be explored. V navigates these 
locations on foot and in vehicles, which are subject to either a first or third-person view. Pedestrians are vulnerable to vehicular collisions. 
Depending on the location, law enforcement may be alerted if V commits a crime. Radio stations are available to listen to. The full day-night cycle and 
dynamic weather affect the way non-player characters (NPCs) behave. V owns an apartment and a garage. Night City features non-English-speaking 
characters, whose languages can be translated with special implants. "Braindance" is a device that allows V to undergo other people's experiences. 
Branching dialogues enable interaction with NPCs and actions in quests. Experience points are obtained from main quests and fuel the stats; side quests 
yield "street cred", unlocking skills, vendors, places, and additional quests. Quests are acquired from characters known as Fixers. Throughout the game, V 
is aided by various companions. Consumables, like soft drink, are used for healing, and objects can be inspected in V's inventory. Minigames include 
hacking, boxing, auto racing, martial arts, and shooting ranges. Player choice leads to different endings.</pre>

attempt to set things right before mankind goes over the edge of extinction.
